## Tasks still need to be done
- TODO: Scroll pages to the right on open (המועצה)
- TODO: Send BI events (https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics) - maybe use the apps engine URL we are already sending?
- TODO: Make PageView work on iOS (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/19030#issuecomment-437534853)
- TODO: Consider validating login phone number using SMS (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50181000/how-to-do-phone-authentication-in-flutter-using-firebase)
- TODO: Make appBar menu RTL (not very important. Couldn't find a way to do it. See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/23501 and https://stackoverflow.com/q/50535185/46635)
