Try to fix list items to open when click anywhere on the item and not only on title link (on the phone)

change facebook icon to be internal to the app

? Make list item header in background color (since hebrew text don't get bold on android)
? Add android menu to send feedback - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8676211/phonegap-menus-and-sub-menus
? Show text and image when no search is entered, and when there are no results
? Change in-site links to open in the application
? Fix slide animation (on android)
? Animate results as they are filtered
? dynamically load data after GUI start (not sure if this is needed - app starts quite fast)
